From the portfolio page, the user can see screenshots of my projects and a small description. The will also be able to click on the screenshots to see the project itself or click on the GitHub link to see the repo page. On the contact page, the user will have access to links to my LinkedIn profile, my GitHub page, and my email. The form is a placeholder until the back-end can be implemented.
